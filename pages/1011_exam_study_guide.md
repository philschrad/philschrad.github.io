MATH1011 Summer 2017/18 

## Exam study guide


All the topics we covered as outlined in the [unit plan] may be assessed, HOWEVER there will NOT be any questions on:

* integrals of vector fields
* the variation of parameters technique

Since the first half of the course was assessed in the mid-summester test the exam will emphasize the second half of the course, but there will still be questions from the first half.

There will be a [formula sheet](https://lms.uwa.edu.au/bbcswebdav/courses/MATH1011_TS-SUMM-B_2018/formula_sheet.pdf).

Here are the [solutions to the mid-sem](https://lms.uwa.edu.au/bbcswebdav/courses/MATH1011_TS-SUMM-B_2018/1011_test_summer_soln.pdf).

Here is a [practice exam](https://lms.uwa.edu.au/bbcswebdav/courses/MATH1011_TS-SUMM-B_2018/1011_sample_exam.pdf), here are the [solutions](https://lms.uwa.edu.au/bbcswebdav/courses/MATH1011_TS-SUMM-B_2018/1011_sample_exam_soln.pdf). Ignore the question on Taylor polynomials - we haven't covered them.

**There will be a combined MATH1011/1012 revision workshop from 9am-12 in MLR3 on Friday 2nd Feb.**
