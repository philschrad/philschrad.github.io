MATH1012 Summer 2017/18 

## Exam study guide


All the topics we covered as outlined in the [unit plan] may be assessed.

Since the first half of the course was assessed in the mid-summester test the exam will emphasize the second half of the course, but there will still be questions from the first half.

The [table of Laplace transforms]() will be provided.

There will NOT be a table of cumulative probabilities of the standard normal distribution. If any such probabilities or quantiles are needed they will be provided in the question. Note that for hypothesis testing we have only covered the critical value method (the p-value method will not be assessed).

Here are the [solutions to the mid-sem](https://lms.uwa.edu.au/bbcswebdav/courses/MATH1012_TS-SUMM-B_2018/1012_test_summer_soln.pdf).

I don't have a practice exam which covers this unit exactly, but I have uploaded two exams from two previous units which cover the same content as 1011 and 1012, but in a different order. So you can attempt the questions on linear algebra, sequences and series in [this exam](https://lms.uwa.edu.au/bbcswebdav/courses/MATH1012_TS-SUMM-B_2018/2014S2Exam.pdf) and ignore everything else. Then attempt only the questions on improper integrals, probability and statistics, Fourier series and Laplace transforms in [this exam](https://lms.uwa.edu.au/bbcswebdav/courses/MATH1012_TS-SUMM-B_2018/2015S2Exam.pdf). It's probably also worth pointing out that these are both three hour exams and yours will only be two hours.

**There will be a combined MATH1011/1012 revision workshop from 9am-12 in MLR3 on Friday 2nd Feb.**
