**Current position:** JSPS postdoctoral research fellow at Tohoku University. My host is Professor Shinya Okabe. I'm working on some geometric ordinary (or partial integro-, depending on the point of view) differential equations. 


### Interests
Geometric variational problems, differential geometry, global analysis, geometric flows.
