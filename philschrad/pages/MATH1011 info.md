###MATH1011 Summer 2017/18 
#General information

## Teaching and learning

### Workshops
There will be 3 workshops each week each lasting for 2 hours. Students are expected to **prepare for each class** by familiarising themselves with the relevant content as outlined in the [unit plan]. Class time will be used for working through the provided problem sheet with the assistance of a demonstrator. Attendance is compulsory as there will be in-class assessments.

### Lectures
There will be **no** face to face lectures for this unit. Instead, brief video lectures (or lecturettes) with accompanying notes and a unit reader will be accessible through LMS. Students are expected to familiarise themselves with this material *before* attending workshops. A list of required viewing/reading for each workshop can be found in the [unit plan].

## Assessment
Assessment consists of in-class activities, a mid-summer test and a final exam.

Item|Weighting|
---|---
Class participation|10%|
Mid-summer test|30%|
Final exam|60%|

If there are medical or other personal circumstances preventing you from completing assessments you will need to make a request for **special consideration** through your *Allocated Course Advice Office* (you can view your Allocated Course Advice Office in [studentConnect](http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/course/studentconnect) under 'Course & Unit'). This must be done within three working days of the assessment.  
**Do not send any requests for special consideration to the unit coordinator or lecturer.**


## Contact
Mathematical questions are likely to also be of interest to fellow students, and so if possible they should be posted in the [discussion board] on LMS. If your question is about the content of a video lecture then you can use the comments section on youtube. Ideally answers will be provided by fellow students (teaching is the best way to master a subject) but if necessary the lecturer will also respond.
    
Other enquiries can be emailed to <philip.schrader@uwa.edu.au> or discussed in person during consultation times (see below).
